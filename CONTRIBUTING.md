* Used the search feature to ensure that the bug hasn't been reported before

Bug reports should contain the following information:

* Summary: A brief description.
* Steps to reproduce: How did you encounter the bug? Instructions to reproduce it.
* Expected behavior: How did you expect it to behave?
* Actual behavior: How did it actually behave?
* References: Links to any related tickets or information sources.

## Git Workflow
Introduction to Github Flow https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/

## Pull Request General Guidelines

* Please check to make sure that there aren't existing pull requests attempting to address the issue mentioned.
* Check for related issues on the issue tracker.
* Non-trivial changes should be discussed on an issue first.
* Let us know you're working on the issue.
* Develop in a topic branch, not master.
* Provide useful  Squash your commits.
* Write a good description of your PR.

### Always follow these rules:  

* Commit each fix as a separate change
* Provide useful commit messages  
* Use the imperative mood in the subject line. Eg. `fix login error`, `add config file`, `remove unused code`   
* Reference the git issue on the body of your commit message, never on the first line. Eg:   
```
git commit -m 'add login feature
connects to #3'
```
* Don't pollute the log! http://bit.ly/1MDciJG
  * Don't push to master any 'merge messages'
  * Update your local development branch with `git pull --rebase origin master`
  * Always Rebase over merge.

## How To Create a Pull Request
__Clone the repo__

* Click the GitHub fork button to create your own fork.
* Clone your fork of the repo to your dev system.

```
git clone git@github.com:gaboesquivel/standard-module-boilerplate.git
```

__Create a feature branch__

```
git checkout -b <your-branch-name>
```

__Make your changes and commit__

* Make sure you comply with the [.editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/)
* Provide a useful short description.
* Reference the git issue on the body of your commit message, never on the first line.
```
git commit -m '<short description of change>
connects to #<your-issue-number>'
```

__Create a Pull Request__

Create a pull request so others can review the changes.

```
git push <your-git-account> <your-feature-branch>
```

* Open your repository fork on GitHub
* You should see a button to create a pull request - Press it
* Reference the issue number in your pull request message.
* Consider mentioning a contributor in your pull request comments to alert them that it's available for review
* **Wait for the reviewer to approve and merge the request**
* Minor documentation grammar/spelling fixes (code example changes should be reviewed)

__For large changes spanning many commits__

* Create a meta-issue with a bullet list using the `* [ ] item` markdown syntax.
* Create issues for each bullet point
* Link to the meta-issue from each bullet point issue
* Check off the bullet list as items get completed

Linking from the bullet point issues to the meta issue will create a list of issues with status indicators in the issue comments stream, which will give us a quick visual reference to see what's done and what still needs doing.


## Advanced Git tools

There are also tools like [Hub](https://hub.github.com/) and [git-extras](https://github.com/tj/git-extras) that facilitate interacting with Github.
You leverage these tools to contribute to this repository.


## Version Numbers

[Semver](http://semver.org), except the version roles have the semantic names, "Breaking.Feature.Fix" instead of "Major.Minor.Patch".


#### Breaking.Feature.Fix

We don't decide what the version will be. The API changes decide. Version numbers are for computers, not people. Release names are for people.

##### Breaking

Any breaking change, no matter how small increments the Breaking version number. Incrementing the Breaking version number has absolutely no relationship with issuing a release.

##### Feature

When any new feature is added. This could be as small as a new public property, or as large as a new module contract being exposed.

##### Fix

When a documented feature does not behave as documented, or when a security issue is discovered and fixed without altering documented behavior.
